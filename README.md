## INTRODUCTION

Nowadays people are driving very fast; accidents are occurring frequently, we lost our valuable life by making small mistake while driving the highway department.Road facilities are a major concern in the developed world. Recent studies show that one third of the number of fatal or serious accidents are associated with excessive or inappropriate speed, as well as changes in the roadway (like the presence of road-work or unexpected obstacles). Reduction of the number of accidents and mitigation of their consequences are a big concern for traffic authorities, the automotive industry and transport research groups. For vehicle safety and safety for passengers in vehicle is an important parameter. Most of the vehicles get accident because no proper safety measures are taken especially at curves and hair pin bends humps and any obstacles in front of the vehicle.

In today’s the various kinds of vehicles have been introduced to provide convenience in human daily life and due to the development of new technologies it makes the vehicle running fast and accelerating easily. Some problems such as the happenings of accidents due to 1.thef, 2.poor mechanical status and maintenance of the car, 3.the poor weather, 4.the high speed, 5.drowsiness and sleepiness or any such type of driver condition, 6.driver’s mistake, 7.loneliness of the driver, 8.problems occur during late night hours.

## RESEARCH

According to the data on Yangon-Mandalay highway, there were 259 car accidents, leaving 113 dead and 625 others injured in 2013. From 1st January to 22ndApril , there were 115 accidents, killing 62 and injuring 286 others in 2014according to Yangon-Mandalay highway.The reason for choosing this research is to prevent the accidents and dangerous 
conditions. Therefore many measures to enforce the safety driving and the development of models to monitor driver’s behaviours have been proposed and 
brought in many promising results.

## EXPLANATION

The safety belt device having an LED lighting fuction according to the present invention is configured such that an LED installed in the safety belt can be controlled to be turned off according to the fastened or unfastened state of the safety belt so as to effectively encourage a driver or a passenger neglecting to fasten his/her safety belt, despite legal regulations on fastening safety belts, to fasten the safety belt. Also, according to the present invention, light from the LED facilitates the positoning of the safety belt at night when the driver or passenger is trying to fasten the safety belt, the light from the LED can be used for illumination inside the vehicle, and the driver and the passenger can be safely protected against a sudden stop or an accident which could occur during the high speed driving of the vehicle by encouraging the driver and the passenger to properly fasten their safety belts.

Sleep Detection

Driver fatigue resulting from sleep deprivation or sleep disorders is an important factor in the increasing number of accidents on today's roads. Most of the accidents occur due to drowsiness. This drowsiness level is detected by use of an eye blink sensor. IR sensor is used to detect the blink of an eye. In this IR transmitter is used to transmit the infrared rays in eye. The IR receiver is used to receive the reflected infrared rays of the eye. If the eye is closed it means the output of IR receiver is high otherwise the IR receiver output is low. This is to know whether the eye is in closing or opening position. The signal is given to the IR transmitter. Whenever the signal is high, the IR transmitter LED conducts it and passes the IR rays to the receiver. Eye blink detection sensor identify the blink of person while driving and their range is compared .The compared output is given to the PIC controller and if the value is greater than the threshold value, then an alarm sound is produced. Here the counting of man eye blink is done. For every 20sec, eye blink is counted and if the count of eye blink is less than the threshold value then alarm sound is produced and immediately intimation is send to owner of the vehicle.

## 4W AND 1H

## WHAT
Seat belt failures, Airbag failures..,
Seat belts are supposed to protect a person from the repercussions of the high impact forces that often occur in accidents. These straps can keep someone being thrown from their seat or striking themselves too forcefully against the interior of the vehicle. Defective seat belts do not offer this crucial protection.
